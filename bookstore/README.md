Description:

The purpose of the Mini Project is to reinforce skills that have been covered in recent modules.Select a data set and analyse it using the techniques learned in recent modules. Prepare and present a 10-minute presentation in class.-----------Rubric:

• Explanation of the business context behind the dataset
• Quality of presentation - engaging, well structured, not too short or too long
• Quality of the notebook - code well documented, runs correctly.

Rules:
The second mini-project is designed to cover the React concepts learned in modules 6 and 7.

The goal is:

To create an interactive page/s of their choice using React. Ideally the app will include interactive elements such as forms, links and buttons, along with routes, data fetching and various React hooks as needed, as well as external libraries such as bootstrap and MUI.

Here are some questions for the students to cover during their presentations:

What was your requirements gathering and design process? Was it useful/successful?Give a high level overview of your application and its featuresWhere does its data come from (external/internal APIs)?How is this data processed and displayed?How can the user interact with your application?How have you structured/broken up your components/code?What kinds of React hooks have you used (eg. state, context, effect, navigate)? How?Have you created and used any custom hooks?What external tools/libraries have you used (eg. bootstrap/axios/MUI)? How? Why?How might you extend the features of your application in future?
